**History is no indicator of future performance. Don't invest what you can't
afford to lose.**

Having said that... *Have A Nice Day Trader* is an algorithmic trading platform
that uses patterns in historic prices to influence future trades. 80 days of
prices are requested for hundreds of currency pairs, then a library of
strategies is backtested over them and a summary is generated.

Prices are fetched using the [CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/).
