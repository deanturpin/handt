History is no indicator of future performance. Don't invest what you can't
afford to lose.

**Have A Nice Day Trader** is an algorithmic trading platform. Prices are
requested for all currency pairs traded by Binance, a library of strategies is
then back-tested over the prices and a strategy summary is produced below. See
the [details](details.md).

Prices are fetched using the [CryptoCompare
API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/).
