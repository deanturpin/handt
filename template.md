**History is no indicator of future performance. Don't invest what you can't
afford to lose.**

Having said that... *Have A Nice Day Trader* is an algorithmic trading
platform.  Prices are requested for all currency pairs traded by Binance and
Coinbase over the last 80 days. A library of strategies is backtested over all
pairs and the summary below is generated. The results are ordered by success
and the advice column is populated if the strategy has returned positively for
the most recent 24-hours of prices.

Prices are fetched using the [CryptoCompare
API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/).
