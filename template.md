**History is no indicator of future performance. Don't invest what you can't
afford to lose.**

*Have A Nice Day Trader* is an algorithmic trading platform. Prices are
requested for all currency pairs traded by Binance over the last 80 days. Then a
library of strategies is back-tested over the prices and a strategy summary is
generated. Prices are fetched using the [CryptoCompare
API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/). See the [details](details.md).
