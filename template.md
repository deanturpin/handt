**History is no indicator of future performance. Don't invest what you can't
afford to lose.**

Having said that... *Have A Nice Day Trader* is an algorithmic trading platform
that uses patterns in historic prices to influence future trades - see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy)
for details. Prices are requested for all currency pairs traded by Binance and Coinbase over the
last 80 days. A library of strategies is backtested over all pairs and the
summary below is generated.

Prices are fetched using the [CryptoCompare
API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/).
